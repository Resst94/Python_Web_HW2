Homework #2.

At this point, your Personal Assistant project most likely exists as a package on the system, installed globally, and uses a version of Python that is installed on the system with the packages installed on the system. Use any convenient pipenv or poetry tool of your choice to create a virtual environment for your program. Fix the version of Python in this environment (be clear: which Python should be used) and configure your IDE to work with the created environment. If you used third-party projects, they should also now have a specific version.

Create a Dockerfile in which to install the Personal Assistant and run it as a separate application in a separate container.
